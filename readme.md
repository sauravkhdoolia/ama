Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

#### Disclaimer

##### Answers from me

All questions are welcome but not all questions will be answered by me.
- Be relevant to me or my opinions in some way and not something anyone could answer (those are better served by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc).
- Be helpful or interesting for other people. I prefer this medium to email because my time spent answering these questions helps more people. Answers that only help the asker are not an efficient use of my time and may not be answered.

#### Other contact mediums

I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sauravkhdoolia) and [email](mailto:hello@sauravk.vision), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/sauravkhdoolia/ama/issues/new).
